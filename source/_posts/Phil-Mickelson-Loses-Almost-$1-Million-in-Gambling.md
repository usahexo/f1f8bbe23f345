#  Phil Mickelson Loses Almost $1 Million in Gambling

In a recent interview, Phil Mickelson has revealed that he lost almost $1 million in gambling in 2018. The 46-year-old golfer admitted to losing the money at casinos over the past year, but said that he doesn't regret it as he had a lot of fun doing it.

Mickelson is one of the most successful golfers in history, with 43 titles to his name. However, this is not the first time that he has lost money through gambling; back in 2009, he revealed that he had lost around $7 million over the course of two years.

Despite his losses, Mickelson says that he still enjoys gambling and will continue to do so in the future. He added that he doesn't mind losing money as long as he has fun while doing it, and that it's all part of the excitement for him.

 Mickelson is not the only high-profile sportsperson to have lost money through gambling; Conor McGregor recently admitted that he had lost $2 million on Irish horse racing in just a few hours.

#  Phil Mickelson Loses Another $1 Million in Gambling

Phil Mickelson lost another $1 million in gambling last week.

This is the latest in a long line of losses for the professional golfer, who has been known to enjoy a bit of gambling on the side. In fact, Mickelson has reportedly lost more than $40 million over the years when gambling away his winnings from tournaments.

It's not clear exactly what Mickelson was betting on last week, but it's safe to say that he came up short. This has been a frustrating year for the 47-year-old golfer, who has failed to win a single tournament.

While some people might view gambling as a waste of money, there's no doubt that Phil Mickelson enjoys it. And as long as he continues to be successful on the golf course, there's no reason for him to stop gambling altogether.

In fact, Mickelson recently said that he plans to keep gambling "as long as I have fun and I'm making money." And based on his recent track record, it looks like he'll continue to lose money in the process.

#  Phil Mickelson's Gambling Habit has Caused Him to Lose Over $2 Million

In 2006, Phil Mickelson was fined by the PGA Tour for violating its anti-gambling policy. He had admitted to gambling on basketball and football games but claimed that he never gambled on golf.

However, in 2016, Phil Mickelson finally came clean and admitted that he has been a habitual gambler for over 20 years. In fact, he has lost over $2 million gambling in that time period.

Most of Phil Mickelson's gambling losses have come from playing blackjack. He is known to be a very aggressive player and often goes all-in when he has a good hand. This strategy usually works well in poker, but it can be disastrous in blackjack.

Despite his losing streak at the casino, Phil Mickelson refuses to give up his gambling habit. In fact, he has even increased his bets in recent years as he looks to win back all of the money that he has lost.

This risky strategy may eventually cost him more than just money. If Phil Mickelson continues to gamble and loses again, he could face disciplinary action from the PGA Tour.

#  Phil Mickelson is In Serious Trouble with His Gambling Addiction

Phil Mickelson is one of the most successful professional golfers in the world, with 43 career PGA Tour victories. He has also won five major championships and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2013. However, Phil Mickelson's success on the course has not come without personal turmoil.

Mickelson has acknowledged that he has a gambling addiction and it has caused him significant financial trouble. In 2013, Mickelson was forced to pay back $1 million to a sports betting company after being caught using insider information to make wagers. The following year, Mickelson was fined nearly $3 million by the Securities and Exchange Commission for violating securities laws.

In May 2018, Mickelson revealed that he had been borrowing money from friends and family to cover his gambling debts. "It's been a ordeal," Mickelson said in an interview with Fox News. "It's been tough to deal with."

While Mickelson has never publicly disclosed how much money he has lost gambling, it is estimated that his addiction has cost him well over $100 million.

Mickelson's struggles with gambling are not unique. Many professional athletes have succumbed to the allure of gambling and ended up losing huge sums of money. Athletes are often attracted to gambling because of the excitement and potential for big wins. However, as Phil Mickelson has learned, these high stakes can also lead to big losses.

Gambling addiction can be very difficult to overcome, but Mickelson is determined to get his life back on track. "I'm focused on getting my game back where it needs to be," Mickelson said in May 2018. "I'm hopeful that I can make some adjustments and get back to winning."

Mickelson will certainly face an uphill battle as he tries to overcome his addiction, but with support from friends and family, he may be able to finally break free from its grip.

#  Phil Mickelson Finally Admits to Losing $10 Million in Gambling

Phil Mickelson confirmed he lost millions of dollars in a gambling spree over the last several years, but said it won't impact his status as one of the top golfers in the world.

"I've made some dumb, stupid bets," Mickelson said Tuesday after a practice round for this week's U.S. Open. "But that's behind me."

Mickelson would not specify how much he lost, but reports have pegged the total at around $10 million. He did say he has gone to great lengths to keep his gambling secret and that none of his fellow golfers are aware of how much money he has actually lost.

"I've done a good job of managing my finances and I have plenty of money," he said. "This was a dumb mistake I made and it's something I'm embarrassed about."

Mickelson, who is currently No. 3 in the world rankings, said he does not expect the gambling losses to affect his game this week or going forward. He is scheduled to compete in next month's British Open and then in August in the PGA Championship, where he will be looking for his fourth major championship title.
