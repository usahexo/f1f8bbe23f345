The Knicks were in need of a helper and Tim Hardaway Jr. stepped up when they needed him most.

Down by one point with just over 10 seconds left on the clock, Knicks head coach Jeff Hornacek called for a play which would go through Hardaway Jr. The plan worked to perfection as Hardaway hit a clutch three-pointer to give New York a 106-104 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Thursday night at Madison Square Garden.

"I love those moments," said Hardaway Jr., who finished with 23 points on the night. "I love being able to take those shots and try to make a difference in the game."

Hardaway Jr.'s big shot was his fifth three-pointer of the night and it came at a crucial time for the Knicks (15-13), who had blown a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter. Enes Kanter led all scorers with 26 points while Kristaps Porzingis chipped in 23 points and nine rebounds for New York. Andre Drummond led Detroit with 24 points and 15 rebounds while Tobias Harris added 22 points.

The Pistons (16-12) had a chance to win it in regulation, but Kentavious Caldwell-Pope's jumper at the buzzer was off the mark. Detroit had won its previous two games heading into Thursday's contest.

"It felt great," Porzingis said of Hardaway Jr.'s game-winner. "Especially when he misses shots early on and he stays positive throughout whole game."

New York will now look to build off Thursday's win when they take on LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday night at The Garden
