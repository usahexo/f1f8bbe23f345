There are a few things to know before venturing out to play poker in a casino in Yemen. The most important is that gambling is illegal in the country, so casinos are discreet, and undercover police may be present. In addition, Yemen is a Muslim country, so dress modestly and avoid behaviors that could be construed as too suggestive.

When you arrive at the casino, you'll likely need to show identification and leave your phone and other electronics in a locker. Casinos in Yemen do not tend to be as large as those in other parts of the world, but they offer a range of table games and slot machines.
