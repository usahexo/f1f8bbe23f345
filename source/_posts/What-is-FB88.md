#  How do they play?

Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each who take turns batting and fielding. The objective of the game is to score more runs than the other team. A run is scored when a player advances around four bases, touching each one before returning to home plate.

The batting team attempts to hit the ball thrown by the pitcher with a wooden or metal bat, and then run around the four bases. The fielding team tries to catch the ball and put out the batsman. Players on the batting team can be put out in several ways: if they are hit by a pitch; if they are caught off base; if they hit the ball into foul territory; or if the third baseman tags them with the ball before they reach first base.

When three outs are made by the fielding team, the batting team rotates one player to the back of the line and a new player comes to bat. The game is over when one team has scored more runs than the other after playing their full complement of innings.

# Origins of baseball

Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games like rounders and cricket. It became popular in America in the mid-19th century, and its rules were standardized in 1845. Today, baseball is considered America's national pastime.

#  When did they establish?
