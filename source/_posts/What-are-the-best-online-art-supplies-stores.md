#  Are there any negatives to buying art supplies online?

When it comes to art supplies, there are a lot of benefits to shopping online. You can find a wider variety of products, you can compare prices easily, and you can often get better deals than you would in stores. However, there are also a few negatives to buying art supplies online.

The first negative is that you can't always see or touch the products before you buy them. This can be a problem if you're not sure what you're looking for or if you need to see the product in person to decide if it's right for you.

Another downside to online art supply shopping is that it can be more expensive than buying from physical stores. This is because online stores typically have higher shipping costs than brick-and-mortar stores do.

Finally, it can sometimes be difficult to find the exact products you want when shopping online. This is especially true if you're looking for specialty items or hard-to-find brands.
