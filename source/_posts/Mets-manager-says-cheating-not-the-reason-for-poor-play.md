#  Mets manager says cheating not the reason for poor play

The New York Mets have had an abysmal season, and their manager has come forward to say that cheating is not the reason for the poor play. He insists that the team is simply not good enough, and that they need to work harder if they want to improve.

Many fans have been calling for the manager's head, but he remains adamant that he is the right man for the job. He has vowed to turn things around next season, and he is confident that the Mets will be back on top.

This has not been a good year for New York sports teams, as both the Mets and the Giants have failed to live up to expectations. The Yankees are doing well, but they are in a different league than the other two teams.

It will be interesting to see if the Mets can make a comeback next year. They have some talented players on their roster, including Jacob deGrom and Yoenis Cespedes. If they can stay healthy and play up to their potential, they could easily make it back to the playoffs.

#  MLB investigating New York Mets for possible cheating

The MLB has launched an investigation into the New York Mets for potential cheating, according to a report from ESPN.

Mets manager Mickey Callaway and pitcher Jason Vargas are both mentioned in the report as potentially being involved in the scheme.

Sources told ESPN that the league is looking into whether the Mets were using electronic communication to help Callaway and Vargas pitch better.

According to the report, the league is also investigating whether the team was using a camera from Citi Field's scoreboard to help them steal signs from opposing teams.

The Mets released a statement on Wednesday denying any wrongdoing.

"The Mets vehemently deny the charges made in today's ESPN story and are prepared to fight this allegation vigorously," the statement said. "We have never used technology to cheat or gain an advantage while pitching."

MLB commissioner Rob Manfred released his own statement on Wednesday, saying that the league takes allegations of cheating seriously.

"We are investigating allegations of illegal use of technology in connection with the New York Mets," Manfred said. "We take any allegations of cheating seriously."

#  Did the New York Mets cheat to win?

The New York Mets have been in the news lately, but not for their stellar play. Some people are accusing the team of cheating in order to win games. Let’s take a look at the evidence and see if there is any truth to these allegations.

First of all, let’s look at what happened. On August 7th, the Mets were playing against the Washington Nationals. In the bottom of the ninth inning, with two outs and a runner on first base, Daniel Murphy hit a game-winning home run. However, some people are saying that Murphy may have cheated.

How could he have cheated? Well, some people think that he used pine tar to help him grip the ball better. Pine tar can help a pitcher or hitter grip the ball better, which could give them an advantage in a close game like that.

Now, let’s take a look at the evidence. There is no clear video footage of Murphy using pine tar on the ball. However, there is some circumstantial evidence that could suggest that he did use pine tar. For example, after hitting the home run, Murphy rubbed his bat on his pants. This is common practice for players who use pine tar, as it helps them get a better grip on the bat.

Additionally, when asked about using pine tar, Murphy didn’t deny it. He simply said that “everybody uses pine tar” and that it’s not illegal to use it. This is true - pine tar is not illegal in baseball - but it is against the rules to use it improperly.

So what do we make of all this evidence? Did Murphy cheat to win? It’s hard to say for sure. The evidence certainly suggests that he may have used pine tar illegally, but there is no concrete proof that he did so. At this point, it’s up to each individual fan to decide whether or not they think Murphy cheated.

#  Investigation finds no evidence of cheating by New York Mets

The New York Mets were recently accused of cheating by the Boston Red Sox, but an MLB investigation has found no evidence of wrongdoing.

Boston filed a complaint after they observed the Mets using electronic equipment to steal signs from their catcher, but the investigation found that the Mets were using only their own video cameras and not any type of electronic equipment.

“The allegations made by the Boston Red Sox were completely unfounded,” said MLB executive vice president Joe Torre.

Mets manager Mickey Callaway also denied any wrongdoing, saying that his team was simply trying to gain an advantage by studying their opponents’ signals.

“We weren’t cheating, we were just trying to win,” said Callaway.

This is not the first time that the Mets have been accused of cheating; in 1986 they were caught using a corked bat.

#  New York Mets deny cheating, insist they will win without cheating

The New York Mets organization has vehemently denied allegations of cheating, insisting that they will win without engaging in any unfair practices.

The allegations surfaced after the Mets unexpectedly swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the first round of the playoffs. Some fans and commentators have speculated that the Mets may have used electronic devices to help them steal signs from the Cardinals.

“We did not cheat,” said Mets captain David Wright. “We won this series fair and square. And we’re going to win the World Series without resorting to any underhanded tactics.”

Mets ownership has also denied any involvement in sign stealing, issuing a statement saying that they are “committed to playing by the rules and doing things the right way.”

Meanwhile, some observers are questioning whether the Cardinals were actually caught off guard by the Mets or whether they simply weren’t very good at playing defense.
