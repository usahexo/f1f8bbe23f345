#  What is Firefly Keno?

Firefly Keno is an online casino game that was released by SG Interactive in February 2019. This game is a variation of the classic keno game, which is a lottery-style casino game in which players choose numbers and hope that they are drawn. In Firefly Keno, players can bet on up to 20 numbers at a time, and they are able to win prizes by matching as few as two of the numbers that they have chosen.

#How to Play Firefly Keno?

To play Firefly Keno, first you need to select how many numbers you want to bet on. You can bet on between 1 and 20 numbers, and you can also choose how much you want to bet on each number. Once you have made your selections, press the “Play” button to begin the game.

The game will then show a board with 20 numbered squares. One of these squares will be randomly selected as the “firefly” square. The firefly square will change every few seconds, so it is important to keep an eye on it. If any of your selected numbers are drawn, then you will win a prize based on your wager amount and the number of winning numbers that you have matched. If the firefly square selects one of your numbers, then you will win a special prize called the “Firefly Jackpot”.

#What are the Prizes in Firefly Keno?

The prizes in Firefly Keno vary depending on how many numbers you match. If you match two out of the five numbers that are drawn, then you will win 2x your original wager amount. If you match three out of five numbers, then you will win 3x your original wager amount. If you match four out of five numbers, then you will win 5x your original wager amount. And finally, if you match all five numbers that are drawn, then you will win 10x your original wager amount!

#  How do you play Firefly Keno?

To play Firefly Keno, you will need a set of keno tickets and a pen. Decide how many tickets you want to play, and fill in the numbers on each ticket. Some casinos provide pencils to make it easier to erase mistakes, but if you're playing at home, a regular pen works just fine.

Next, decide how much money you want to wager on the game. Each number on the ticket costs a certain amount, and you can bet up to five times on each number. So if you have a three-digit number like 123, you can bet up to fifteen dollars: $1 on the first number, $2 on the second number, and $3 on the third number.

Once you've decided how much money you want to wager, it's time to start playing! Look at the keno board to see which numbers have been called. If one of your numbers is among those called, mark it off on your ticket with a X. The more numbers that are called that appear on your ticket, the more money you win!

If all of your numbers are called, you automatically win the grand prize! In most cases, you can also collect smaller prizes for having two or three numbers called. Be sure to read the rules at your casino or online keno site to find out exactly how much money you can win for each type of bet.
