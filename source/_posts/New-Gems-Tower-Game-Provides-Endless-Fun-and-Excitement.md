#  A New Twist on an Old Favorite - Gems Tower Game

Few games are as well-loved as Gems Tower, a classic puzzle game that has been around for decades. But even the classics can use a bit of a facelift, and that's just what we've done with Gems Tower - given it a new twist that makes it even more fun to play!

In our updated version of the game, gems drop from the top of the screen, and you must place them in the tower on the left. When you make a row or column of 3 or more gems of the same color, they disappear, and any gems above them fall down to fill the empty spaces. The goal is to clear all of the gems from the screen before they reach the bottom.

We've also added some new power-ups to help you out. The bomb gem clears out all gems of one color from the screen, and the lightning gem destroys all adjacent gems. There are also positive and negative power-ups - the positive ones let you destroy more gems at once, while the negative ones make things more difficult by making gems harder to move or slowing down your movement.

So come on over and check out our new twist on an old favorite - Gems Tower!
