#  How to Determine the Winning Poker Hand 

When playing poker, the player with the best hand is declared the winner. The ranking of hands is standard, with a straight flush being the highest and four of a kind being the lowest. In order to determine the winning hand, each player must declare their hand and compare them against one another. The following guide will help players determine which hand beats which.

1) Royal Flush: This is the best possible hand in poker and consists of 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace, all of the same suit. If two players have a royal flush, the player with the higher card wins.

2) Straight Flush: A straight flush is five consecutive cards of the same suit. The ranking of straight flushes is determined by the rank of the highest card in the sequence. For example, a 10-9-8-7-6 straight flush would beat a 5-4-3-2-A straightflush. If both players have a straight flush, then the player with the highest card within their sequence wins.

3) Four of a Kind: This hand contains four cards of equal rank and one other card. The rank of four of a kind is determined by the rank of the cards within the set. For example, two 9s and two 4s would beat two 6s and two 2s. If both players have four of a kind, then ties are broken by considering either kicker (the odd card not part of any set) or suit. If both players have identical kicker cards, then suits are compared to determine a winner.

4) Full House: A full house contains three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. The rank of full houses is determined by comparing only the ranks of the three matching cards; suits are not taken into consideration when ranking these hands. For example, 8-8-8 would beat A-A-K since it has an 8 as its highest ranked card as opposed to an A. If both players have full houses then ties are broken by comparing kickers or suits (if kicker cards are identical).  
5) Flush: A flush contains five cards all of which are from the same suit but not necessarily in consecutive order. When comparing flushes, only those containing five matching cards are considered; if two flushes contain different numbers off matched cards (e.g., 4♥ 5♠ 6♦ 7♣ 8♠ vs 4♣ 5♦ 6♥ 7♥ 8♦), then only one flush—the higher ranked one—is awarded to either player involved in that particular matchup.. The order for suits is as follows: clubs ♣ diamonds ♦ hearts ♥ spades ♠ . If both players have flushes then ties are broken by kicker or suit (if kicker cards are identical). 
6) Straight: A straight consists 5 consecutively rankedcards not all from th e same suit . When comparing straights , only those containing five matching c ards will be cons idered ; if two straights cont ain different numb

#  How to Judge Poker Hands 

As any experienced poker player knows, different hands are worth different amounts. The strength of your hand is one of the most important factors in winning a hand - and ultimately the game.

But how do you know what is a strong hand, and what isn't? Well, that all depends on the type of poker game you're playing. In Texas Hold'em, for example, the strongest hand is a royal flush - five cards of the same suit in sequence. In games like Omaha or 7 Card Stud, however, a royal flush is much harder to come by, as players are dealt four cards instead of two.

In general, the higher the rank of the card, the stronger the hand. So an ace-king (A-K) would be stronger than a two-five (2-5). But there are other factors to consider too. For example, if you have two paired cards - such as two queens (Q-Q) - that would be a stronger hand than an ace-high (A-K).

Of course, there are also wildcards which can make things more complicated. A three of a kind (3-3-3) is stronger than a pair (2-2), but weaker than two pairs (Q-Q). And if you have a wildcard in your hand, it can basically be used as any other card to make up a better hand.

So now you know how to judge the strength of your poker hands. But remember that it's not just about having the best hand - you also need to be smart about how you play them. Sometimes it's better to fold than risk losing everything with a weak hand.

#  The Exact Poker Hand Rankings

This is a comprehensive guide to the rank of poker hands.



The rank of poker hands starts with the highest- ranked hand and goes down in rank as the hands become less powerful. The Royal Flush is the highest-ranked hand and is made up of the Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten of the same suit. The Straight Flush is next in rank and is made up of five cards in sequence all of the same suit. Four of a Kind is next, followed by Full House which consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. Then we have Flush which consists off five cards all of the same suit but not necessarily in sequence. The final hand that beats Two Pairs is a Pair which contains two cards of one rank and two different ranks.


Now let’s take a look at how these hands are ranked:

Royal flush   – A, K, Q, J, 10 
Straight flush  - any five consecutive cards all of the same suit 
Four a kind - four cards of equal rank 
Full house - three cards of one rank and two cards of another (e.g., 3♥ 3♦ 2♣ 1♠) 
Flush - any five cards all suits but not consecutive (e.g., 5♦ 4♦ 3♣ 2♥) 
Two pairs  - e.g., 2♥ 2♦ 4♠ 6♥) 
Pair - two cards equal to rank (e.g., 7♣ 7♦)
