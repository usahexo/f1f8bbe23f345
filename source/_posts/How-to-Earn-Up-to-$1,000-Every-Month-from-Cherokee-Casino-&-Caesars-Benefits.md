#  How to Turn Your Cherokee Casino & Caesars Benefits into a Steady Stream of Income

Too many people seem to think that being a Cherokee casino & caesars benefits member means they can just sit back and not worry about anything. The truth is that, if you’re not careful, your casino & caesars benefits could quickly turn into a major expense. This is especially true if you like to gamble.

The easiest way to make sure your Cherokee casino & caesars benefits don’t become a drain on your finances is to turn them into a steady stream of income. Here are a few tips on how to do that:

#1: Use Your Hotel Benefits

One of the best things about being a Cherokee casino & caesars benefits member is the number of free hotel rooms you get each year. If you’re not using them, you’re wasting valuable benefits. Start using your hotel rooms and you can easily turn your Cherokee casino & caesars benefits into an income stream.

#2: Rent Out Your Rooms When You’re Not Using Them

If you don’t want to use your hotel rooms, you can always rent them out to other people. This can be a great way to make some extra money and it doesn’t require much work on your part. Just make sure you screen your tenants carefully and avoid letting anyone trash your room.

#3: Play the Table Games Strategically

If you like to gamble, try playing the table games strategically. This means only betting what you can afford to lose and walking away when you reach that limit. By playing this way, you can enjoy yourself without worrying about going broke.

#4: Use Your Dining Credits Wisely

Another great benefit of being a Cherokee casino & caesars benefits member is the number of dining credits you get each year. Rather than spending them all at once, try spreading them out over time. This will help you save money and make sure you get the most out of your dining credits.
