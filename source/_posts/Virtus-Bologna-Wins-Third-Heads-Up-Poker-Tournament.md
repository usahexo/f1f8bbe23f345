#  Heads up poker: Virtus Bologna prove they're the best

The 2018-19 Serie A season is coming to an end, and one of the most interesting subplots is the battle for the last Champions League spot. At the moment, three teams are vying for it: Lazio, Inter and Roma. However, a fourth team could still have a say in the matter: Virtus Bologna.

Virtus have been on a good run of form lately, winning their past four matches. This included an impressive 3-1 victory over Inter last weekend. If they can keep this up, they will definitely be in with a chance of qualifying for Europe's top club competition.

There are several reasons why Virtus have been performing so well recently. Their main strength is their attack, which is spearheaded by Brazilian striker André Silva. Silva has been in excellent form this season, scoring 16 goals in 24 appearances. He is supported by two very dangerous wingers, Domenico Berardi and Federico Santander.

The midfield trio of Erick Pulgar, Roberto Soriano and Simone Verdi are also very important to the team's success. They provide plenty of creativity and guile in the middle of the park, allowing the forwards to cause havoc up front.

The defence has also been playing well lately. Led by captain Gianmarco Ferrari, they have kept three clean sheets in their past four matches. This solid backline is also helped by goalkeeper Antonio Mirante, who has been in superb form this season.

If Virtus can continue their good form until the end of the season, they will definitely qualify for the Champions League. They will face some tough opponents in the group stages, but with their current form they definitely have a chance of progressing to the next round.
