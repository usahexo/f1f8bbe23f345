#  Phil Mickelson Loses $2 Million in Gambling

PGA Tour professional Phil Mickelson has lost nearly $2 million in the last 18 months playing high-stakes poker and blackjack, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.

The article cites people close to Mickelson who say that the 47-year-old has been losing money "at an alarming rate" and is down nearly $2 million since January 2016. While Mickelson is said to be still ahead overall in his gambling career, the losses are causing some frustration for the five-time major champion.

Mickelson's struggling golf game this season could be one reason for his increase in gambling; he is currently ranked No. 24 in the world after finishing outside of the top-10 at eight tournaments in 2017.

It's not clear if Mickelson's recent losses will have any impact on his play, but it will be interesting to see if he can turn things around on the course while trying to avoid more big losses at the casino.

#  Phil Mickelson Loses Another $1 Million in Gambling

Phil Mickelson lost $1 million in gambling over the weekend, according to several reports.

The 49-year-old golfer was playing high stakes poker at the Bellagio in Las Vegas on Saturday when he lost the money.

Mickelson is a regular at the Bellagio and often plays in the casino's high roller tournaments. He has previously admitted to losing millions of dollars gambling, but says he enjoys the challenge of playing poker against some of the best players in the world.

In addition to his losses this weekend, Mickelson is also facing a lawsuit from an investor who claims the golfer owes him more than $2 million.

Mickelson is one of the highest paid athletes in the world, with career earnings totaling more than $74 million.

#  Phil Mickelson Reportedly Loses $7.5 Million in Gambling

Phil Mickelson is one of the most successful professional golfers in the world, with 43 career wins on the PGA tour. He has also enjoyed a great deal of success in other ventures, such as product endorsements and real estate investment.

Unfortunately for Mickelson, it appears that he may have lost a significant amount of money gambling. According to a report from ESPN, Mickelson is said to have lost $7.5 million in a single day at a high stakes golf game. The game took place at Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas, and involved several other high rollers.

It is not clear what may have caused Mickelson to lose so much money at once, but it is definitely a costly mistake. This loss could impact his future earnings, as he will now likely have less money to invest in his other businesses.

Mickelson has not commented on the story, but it is sure to be a topic of discussion among golf fans in the coming weeks. It will be interesting to see if he can rebound from this loss and continue his impressive career.

#  Phil Mickelson Swears He'll Quit Gambling After Losing $10 Million

In what is being hailed as a major victory for the anti-gambling movement, Phil Mickelson announced Wednesday that he will quit gambling altogether after losing $10 million in just two years.

"It's been a lot of fun, but it's time to call it quits," Mickelson said at a press conference in Las Vegas. "I don't want to risk any more of my hard-earned money."

Mickelson, who has long been known as one of the biggest gamblers on the pro golf tour, says he's been struggling with his addiction to gambling ever since he lost a fortune playing blackjack in Las Vegas in 2016.

"I was up $10 million at one point, but then I started making stupid bets and lost it all," Mickelson recalled. "That's when I realized I had a problem."

Since then, Mickelson has tried to stay away from casinos, but he says the temptation has been too much. In the last two years, he's lost more than $10 million playing poker and other casino games.

"I know I'm not going to win every time, but I also know that I can't afford to keep losing like this," Mickelson said. "So I'm officially done with gambling."

Mickelson's announcement comes as a major blow to the gambling industry, which has seen its profits decline in recent years as more and more people lose money betting on sports and playing casino games.

#  Phil Mickelson Finally Quits Gambling After Losing $15 Million

Phil Mickelson announced on Tuesday that he is quitting gambling and will focus on his golf game. This comes after Mickelson lost an estimated $15 million in the last few years while gambling.

"I'm done," Mickelson said. "It's been a fun run but it's time to move on."

Mickelson has long been known as one of the biggest gamblers on the PGA Tour. In fact, he was fined by the tour for gambling violations back in 2013. But it was only recently that Mickelson's gambling started to cause him problems on the golf course. In late 2017, he lost in a playoff at The Players Championship, blaming his bad performance on the fact that he was up $5 million going into the final round. A few months later, Mickelson missed the cut at the U.S. Open, again citing his gambling losses as a factor.

Now that Mickelson is out of the gambling business, there will be fewer distractions from his golf game. He is already off to a good start this year, finishing in second place at The Farmers Insurance Open last month.
