        <h1 id="Phil-Mickelson’s-Gambling-Habit-Costs-Him-Millions"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson’s-Gambling-Habit-Costs-Him-Millions" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson’s Gambling Habit Costs Him Millions"></a>Phil Mickelson’s Gambling Habit Costs Him Millions</h1><p>Phil Mickelson is one of the most successful professional golfers in history, with 42 career wins on the PGA Tour. He’s also been one of the most consistent players in the sport, making the cut in more than 80% of tournaments he’s entered. But all that success has not come without a cost - Mickelson’s gambling habit has reportedly cost him millions of dollars over the years.</p>
<p>Mickelson first started gambling while he was still a college student, and his habit began to take a toll on his finances after he turned pro. In 2004, he lost $2 million playing poker at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. The following year, he dropped another $5 million at the same casino. And in 2006, he lost $1 million in just 10 minutes playing blackjack.</p>
<p>Mickelson has admitted that his gambling addiction has cost him a lot of money, but he insists that it has never had a negative impact on his golf game. “I’ve been very lucky that it hasn’t affected my play,” Mickelson said in 2007. “But it definitely has taken a chunk out of my finances.”</p>
<p>Despite his losses, Mickelson continues to gamble and shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, he may be getting even more serious about it in recent years. Late last year, reports surfaced that Mickelson had made a $2 million bet on Tiger Woods to win the 2016 Masters Tournament. Woods ended up falling short, finishing in 15th place, but Mickelson still walked away with a nice payday.</p>
<p>Whether or not Mickelson will ever break free from his gambling addiction remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure - it’s costing him a lot of money. In addition to the millions he’s lost at casinos over the years, Mickelson has also reportedly spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on private jets and high-end hotels to facilitate his gambling trips. It’s safe to say that Phil Mickelson could use some financial help - and fast!</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Mickelson-Loses-3-Million-in-Just-One-Night-of-Gambling"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson-Loses-3-Million-in-Just-One-Night-of-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson Loses $3 Million in Just One Night of Gambling"></a>Phil Mickelson Loses $3 Million in Just One Night of Gambling</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and thrilling experience, but for Phil Mickelson, it was anything but that on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>According to reports, Mickelson lost a whopping $3 million in just one night of gambling at the casino. This comes as a bit of a surprise, as the 46-year-old professional golfer is typically very successful when it comes to gambling.</p>
<p>“I think I’m still ahead from when I started, but it’s not what I wanted,” Mickelson said about his night at the casino. “It’s frustrating to play well and lose like that.”</p>
<p>Mickelson has been known to enjoy a good game of poker from time to time, but it’s unclear what game he was playing that resulted in such a massive loss. Whatever the case may be, we’re sure Mickelson is hoping to forget this night ever happened.</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Mickelson’s-Gambling-addiction-costs-him-7-million"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson’s-Gambling-addiction-costs-him-7-million" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson’s Gambling addiction costs him $7 million"></a>Phil Mickelson’s Gambling addiction costs him $7 million</h1><p>Golf superstar Phil Mickelson reportedly lost $7 million to high-stakes gambling in the past seven years.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old southpaw has a well-documented history of betting on sports, and it seems that his losses have taken a toll on his finances. In 2016, he agreed to pay $1.1 million in back taxes after admitting he had moved money around between different accounts in order to conceal his gambling winnings.</p>
<p>Mickelson is thought to have placed his biggest bets on NFL and college football games, but like any good gambler, he also enjoys taking risks with less predictable outcomes. In 2013, he placed a nearly $3 million bet on Tiger Woods to win the Masters - a move which would have netted him a cool $1 million profit had Woods prevailed.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Mickelson has never been shy about discussing his love for gambling; in fact, he has often referred to it as a “hobby.” In an interview with ESPN back in 2009, he said “I enjoy the competition… I enjoy feeling the pressure of making a decision that can make or break me.”</p>
<p>It’s this sort of bravado which has helped make Mickelson one of the most successful players in golf history. With 42 career wins on the PGA Tour (including five major championships), he is undoubtedly one of the greatest golfers of all time. However, his recent losses will no doubt raise some questions about his long-term financial security.</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Mickelson’s-bets-cost-him-more-than-10-million"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson’s-bets-cost-him-more-than-10-million" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson’s bets cost him more than $10 million"></a>Phil Mickelson’s bets cost him more than $10 million</h1><p>In what might be the costliest putting lesson ever, Phil Mickelson has reportedly lost more than $10 million in various bets against Rickie Fowler.</p>
<p>The duo has been going head-to-head in a putting competition for years now, and it seems that Mickelson is coming out on the losing end. In fact, the last time Fowler beat Lefty in a putting contest was in 2013.</p>
<p>“I’ve been paying him all these years,” Mickelson joked to reporters. “It’s nice to finally have something go my way.”</p>
<p>While the losses haven’t seemed to affect Mickelson’s game on the course, they have certainly taken their toll on his wallet. And with so much money at stake, it’s no wonder that these two are so determined to win.</p>
<p>“We’re both pretty competitive,” Fowler said of their ongoing rivalry. “We want to win, and we’re not going to give up easily.”</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Mickelson-reportedly-loses-more-than-15-million-in-gambling"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson-reportedly-loses-more-than-15-million-in-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson reportedly loses more than $15 million in gambling"></a>Phil Mickelson reportedly loses more than $15 million in gambling</h1><p>Phil Mickelson has always been known as a bit of a gambler, and it looks like that side of his personality may have finally caught up with him. According to reports, Mickelson recently lost more than $15 million in a single gambling session.</p>
<p>This news will likely come as a shock to many of Mickelson’s fans, as the golfer has always tried to maintain a very public image of being a family man and a role model. However, it is important to remember that Mickelson is still human, and that he is bound to make some mistakes along the way.</p>
<p>At this point, it is unclear how Mickelson intends to pay back the $15 million he lost. He may try to dip into his personal fortune, or he may approach some of his wealthy friends for help. No matter what happens, it is clear that Mickelson is going to be feeling the financial effects of this debacle for quite some time.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how Mickelson handles this situation moving forward. He has always been known as one of the most competitive athletes in the world, and it is possible that he will use this lose as motivation to improve his game even further. In any case, we wish Phil all the best in whatever he decides to do next.</p>
